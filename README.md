# Collector

The Data Distribution System is designed to efficiently handle the flow of data within the ecosystem. This system involves various components such as Collectors, Archivers, Validators, Distributors, and more. The system revolves around the Collector, which saves incoming data chunks from Archivers or Distributors into log files and an SQLite database. Active Validators generate data passed on to Archivers, which in turn distribute it to various services like Explorers, JSON-RPC servers, and wallets for end-user access.

## Development

1. Clone the repository and switch to `dev` branch

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shardeum/relayer-collector.git
cd relayer-collector/
git checkout dev
npm install
```

2. Configure the [config.json](./config.json) with correct `distributorInfo` and `collectorInfo`

Set the **ip**, **port**, and **publicKey** of the distributor service in the `distributorInfo` object, and the public and secret keys of the collector service in the `collectorInfo` object. You can request distributor and collector info from the Shardeum team or else you can generate a key-pair of your own and request the administrator to whitelist your keys on the one of the running distributors.

```bash
"distributorInfo": {
 "ip": "<distributor-server-ip>",     //eg: 127.0.0.1
 "port": "<distributor-server-port>", //eg: 6100
 "publicKey": "distributor-server-public-key"
},
 
"collectorInfo": {
 "publicKey": "<collector-pub-key>",
 "secretKey": "<collector-secret-key>"
}
```

To generate key-pair for collector, do the following

```bash
# Navigate to the Shardeum repository
cd path/to/shardeum/repo  # https://github.com/shardeum/shardeum

# Generate a new wallet
node scripts/generateWallet.js
```

3. Update `src/config/index.ts` with the following settings

```bash
enableShardeumIndexer: false,
blockIndexing: {
  enabled: true,
},
enableCollectorSocketServer: false
```

The `enableShardeumIndexer` flag, when enabled, allows the collector to save accounts data in a format required by the service Validator, in addition to its standard data storage; it's typically set to `false` for most use cases.

4. Now you can compile the project using the following command

```bash
npm run prepare
```

5. To start the main data collector, run

```bash
pm2 start --name collector-data-server --node-args="--max_old_space_size=16000" npm -- run collector
```

6. Monitor the collector logs

```bash
pm2 logs
```

Check the logs for any errors or issues during startup and operation. By following these steps, you'll have the collector set up and connected to the distributor, ready to receive and process data from the Shardeum network.

## Working

### Collector Service

The Collector service connects to a distributor service as configured in [config.json](./config.json). It can be started with the following command:

```bash
npm run collector
```

Here's what the Collector does:

- **Data Syncing:** Initiates a data syncing process in which it queries all the historical data (Accounts, Transactions, Receipts etc) from the distributor and saves it to its own SQLite DB.
- **Real-time Data Subscription:** Simultaneously, it subscribes to real-time data from the distributor and writes it to a log file (under **`/data-logs`**) and the SQLite DB.

### Server

This API Server is used to expose the data stored in the SQLite DB to the RPC Server, if you intend to point an RPC to the collector data. The server can be started using:

```bash
npm run server
```

### Log Server

The **`log_server`** hosts an endpoint named `/evm_log_subscription`, specifically designed for hosting on-chain event logs like `eth_getLogs`. This feature further enhances the capabilities and accessibility of the system.

The log server can be started using:

```bash
npm run log_server
```
